						<p>Scientists, researchers and technical experts today are juggling with the various drawbacks of computer systems like:</p>
						<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
							<li>Speed</li>
							<li>Performance</li>
							<li>Processing Capabilities</li>
							<li>Efficiency</li>
							<li>Memory</li>
							<li>Physical Space</li>
						</ul>
						<p>While the scale of computational power has gone leaps and bounds, the requirements have also scaled exponentially. To tackle this scenario, the concept of distributed computing was brought into the scope of computer systems. Organizations today have registered users donating their idle CPU power and time for running scientific iterations and calculations. For example, Folding@Home is a Stanford University made distributed computing system to simulate and model various calculations involved in folding of proteins. Researchers and scientists get benefitted by these ventures, as common people are supporting established universities and research organizations with their computing power.</p>
						<p>We intend to develop a system that essentially provides computing power to common everyday users and the academic community. It is common for high schools to have large number of systems. There is a computer in almost every household today. If a student wishes to perform an experiment or run a simulation that is drawing too much power from his or her own system, they can make use of this technology to get results faster. This technology will prove to be a boon for the open source community, as the need for large computing power will eventually arise with the development of AI and associated technologies, and amateur developers that are looking to learn but do not have access to sufficiently advanced resources will be able to envision their ideas without being hindered by physical non-availability of resources.</p>
						<p>We intend to develop a network daemon that will need to be installed onto a system and connect to the internet. In a network of registered users, the user requesting computing power will outsource the tasks to one or more of the other systems. Based on the action of protocols and daemon, specific executions, iterations and processing will happen on different systems at different times. Also, the single thought of all the energy, time, and space one could save by making use of this kind of a system is an indicative of a promising venture. Join us today and become a part of a future powered by us.</p>
